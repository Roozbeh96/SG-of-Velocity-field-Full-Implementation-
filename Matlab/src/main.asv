%{
To Stochatically Generate Velocity Profiles (SGVP), reorganize, and add vortex
cores, you need to provide initial physical parameters such as
u_{tau}(friction velocity), z_{0}(aerodynamic roughness length),
delta(boundary layer thickness), lambda(Taylor micro-scale). The details 
about the rest of the parameter will be providing the following lines.
If you need details about the statistics, refer to the following papers:
